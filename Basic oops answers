1.) Interface is a fully unimplemented class,In which all methods are abstract and public by default till java 1.7v,
means that all the method present inside interface have only declartion but not body,implementation class is responsible to provide
body.it is use to provide all the rules for an application .Example - Take an example of Bank application ,as we know that
all bank have same functionality but may be different behaviour so,for creation of Bank 
application we can declare all the functionality inside an interface and its behaviour may varied from bank to bank. 
Abstract class is a partially implemented class,means it may have abstract method.Basically we use abstract class to define common
behaviour .For example -In bank application there are some common behaviour like withdraw and deposite,so we can define this funtionality
inside an abstract class to overcome complexity problem.
Concrete class is fully implemented class and we can not declare any abstract method inside it,means all the method present inside it
have body.
Example- We have best example present in collection framework to explain these concept is List interface .In list interface all
functionality is declare inside it and it's direct implementaion class is Abstract list class, in which all common behaviour is present 
inside it which is a abstract class.And ArryList ,LinkedList,Vector,etc are the concrete class.
